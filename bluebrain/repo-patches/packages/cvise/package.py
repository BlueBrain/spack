class Cvise(CMakePackage):
    """C-Vise is a super-parallel Python port of the C-Reduce. The port is
    fully compatible to the C-Reduce and uses the same efficient LLVM-based
    C/C++ reduction tool named clang_delta.

    C-Vise is a tool that takes a large C, C++ or OpenCL program that has a
    property of interest (such as triggering a compiler bug) and automatically
    produces a much smaller C/C++ or OpenCL program that has the same property.
    It is intended for use by people who discover and report bugs in compilers
    and other tools that process C/C++ or OpenCL code."""
